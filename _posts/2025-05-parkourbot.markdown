ParkourBot extends Unitree RL GYM with a two‑tier hierarchical reinforcement learning pipeline that enables a Unitree G1 to walk and high‑step through dense, obstacle‑rich mazes. A high‑level Q‑learning planner reasons over a 3‑D grid map to switch among specialised low‑level PPO gait controllers, yielding parkour‑style manoeuvres in simulation.

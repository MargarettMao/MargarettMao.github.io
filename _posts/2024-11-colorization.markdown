Inthispaper,weexploremethodsforsketch-to-imagecolorization,focusingonenhancingtheperformanceand adaptability of generative models to handle diverse data domains and mitigate domain shifts between training and testing phases. Our approach, built on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) framework, incorporates multiple domain adaptation techniques and demonstrates the ability to extract domain-invariant features. This enables the trained models to generalize effectively across different data domains, resulting in significant improvements in colorization performance for out-of-distribution sketches.

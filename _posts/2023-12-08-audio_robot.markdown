This project explores how principles of movement sonification (the mapping of motion to sound) can inspire more perceptive and adaptive robotic systems. By analyzing how auditory cues convey contact forces during manipulation, I examined how sound can complement visual feedback in robot learning. The study highlights the potential of integrating audio perception into multimodal robot representations, bridging insights from human motor cognition and embodied AI.

In this project, our system autonomously performs a dynamic pick-and-place-and-stack task for both static and moving objects. By integrating vision and advanced motion planning, we achieve high-precision manipulation capable of stacking cubes on both stationary and rotating platforms.Dynamic pick-and-place motion planning for robotic manipulation using the Franka arm. This project focuses on real-time motion planning and control for complex manipulation tasks.
